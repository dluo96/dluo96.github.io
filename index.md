# Hello there!

I'm a research engineer, physicist, and biotechnologist. I'm driven by a desire to connect ideas across disciplines to better understand the world.

At InstaDeep/BioNTech, I helped develop generative models for mRNA vaccines. This was published at [NeurIPS](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.11.21.568057v1.full.pdf). I also helped scale model training via GPU profiling and optimization.Before that, I was a key contributor to [Jumanji](https://github.com/instadeepai/jumanji), a suite of reinforcement learning environments written in JAX. This was published at [ICLR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09884).

At Datatonic, I worked directly with clients to implement end-to-end solutions on Google Cloud. This included developing an open source MLOps template in close collaboration with Google Cloud. As a technical advisor for prospective customers, I also helped scope enterprise contracts.

A few other facts about me:

- I won the Danish Physics Olympiad and represented Denmark at the International Physics Olympiad (IPhO). 
- Intrigued by biology, I decided to study biotechnology at Cambridge University. 
- I graduated from Oxford University with a First class degree in Physics.
- I broke an Oxford University Swimming Club record and received two [Full Blues](https://www.sport.ox.ac.uk/blues-awards).
