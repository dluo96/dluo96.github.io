# Hi there!

I'm a research engineer, physicist, and biotechnologist. I want to understand the world, in the deepest possible sense, by connecting ideas across different fields. 

At [InstaDeep/BioNTech](https://instadeep.com/), I helped develop generative models for mRNA vaccines (our work was published at [NeurIPS](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.11.21.568057v1.full.pdf)). I also helped scale model training via GPU profiling and optimization. Before that, I was a key contributor to [Jumanji](https://github.com/instadeepai/jumanji), a suite of reinforcement learning environments written in JAX. We published this work at [ICLR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09884).

At [Datatonic](https://datatonic.com/), I worked directly with clients to implement end-to-end solutions on Google Cloud. This included developing an open source [MLOps template](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/vertex-pipelines-end-to-end-samples) in collaboration with Google Cloud. As a technical advisor for prospective customers, I also helped scope enterprise contracts.

A few other facts about me:

- I won the [Danish Physics Olympiad](https://www.ipho2013.dk/fysikolympiade/). Then, I represented Denmark at the International Physics Olympiad ([IPhO](https://ipho-unofficial.org/)). 
- I studied biotech at Cambridge University. 
- I graduated from Oxford University with a First class Physics degree.
- I broke an [Oxford University Swimming Club record](https://www.ousc.info/records/mens-sc-records/) and received two [Full Blues](https://www.sport.ox.ac.uk/blues-awards).

Recently, I've been learning CUDA and Triton so I can write [custom GPU kernels](https://github.com/dluo96/gpu-programming).
