  <h1>Hi there!</h1>

  <p>I'm a research engineer, physicist, and biotechnologist. I want to understand the world, in the deepest possible sense, by connecting ideas across different fields.</p>

  <p>At InstaDeep/BioNTech, I helped develop generative models for mRNA vaccines (our work was published at NeurIPS). I also helped scale model training via GPU profiling and optimization. Before that, I was a key contributor to Jumanji, a suite of reinforcement learning environments written in JAX. We published this work at ICLR.</p>

  <p>At Datatonic, I worked directly with clients to implement end-to-end solutions on Google Cloud. This included developing an open source MLOps template in collaboration with Google Cloud. As a technical advisor for prospective customers, I also helped scope enterprise contracts.</p>

  <p>A few other facts about me:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>I won the Danish Physics Olympiad. Then, I represented Denmark at the International Physics Olympiad (IPhO).</li>
    <li>I studied biotech at Cambridge University.</li>
    <li>I graduated from Oxford University with a First class Physics degree.</li>
    <li>I broke an Oxford University Swimming Club record and received two Full Blues.</li>
    <li>Recently, I've been learning CUDA and Triton so I can write custom GPU kernels.</li>
  </ul>
